# PYTHON CODE: MERGE LIDAR TIFF FILES INTO ONE FILE
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The study area within the London metropolitan area is large. The Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data from the Environment Agency are available at data.gov.uk (accessed July 2nd 2018, licensed under the Open Government Licence 3.0). This data are available at a pixel resolution of 1 m or 2 m. For our analysis, both the Digital Surface Model and Digital Terrain Model were used at 2 m spatial resolution. This included merging several 1000s of .tiff files into one using the Python code below.
